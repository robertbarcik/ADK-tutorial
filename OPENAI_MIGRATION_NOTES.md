# OpenAI API Migration Notes

## Overview

The ADK tutorial notebooks have been updated to use **OpenAI API** instead of Google AI Studio. This change provides students with flexibility in model choice and avoids quota limitations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

**Added:**
- `litellm>=1.0.0` - Enables ADK to work with OpenAI and other LLM providers
- `openai>=1.0.0` - OpenAI Python client library

**Removed:**
- `google-genai>=0.3.0` - No longer needed for OpenAI

### 2. Both Notebooks Updated

#### Installation Cell
```python
!pip install -q google-adk litellm openai python-dotenv nest-asyncio
```

#### Imports
Added:
```python
from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm
```

#### API Key Configuration
- Changed from `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Updated Colab secrets name to `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Updated API key URL to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Added model selection configuration

#### Model Selection
Added configurable model selection:
```python
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Can be changed to other models
```

**Available Models:**
- `gpt-4o` - Most capable model
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Cost-efficient, recommended for students
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Previous generation
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Fastest, most economical

#### Agent Creation
Changed from:
```python
LlmAgent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    ...
)
```

To:
```python
LlmAgent(
    model=LiteLlm(model=f"openai/{OPENAI_MODEL}"),
    ...
)
```

### 3. Tool Compatibility

**Important:** OpenAI API (unlike Google AI Studio) **supports default parameter values** in function tools. However, we kept the current implementation without defaults for consistency.

If you want to add default parameters with OpenAI, you can now safely do:
```python
def search_knowledge_base(query: str, max_results: int = 3) -> Dict[str, any]:
    # This will work with OpenAI!
```

## Student Instructions

### Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key and save it securely
5. Add it to Colab secrets or paste when prompted

### Setting Up in Colab

**Option 1: Colab Secrets (Recommended)**
1. Click the ðŸ”‘ icon in the left sidebar
2. Click "+ Add new secret"
3. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Value: Your API key
5. Toggle on notebook access

**Option 2: Direct Input**
The notebook will prompt you to enter the key securely when you run the authentication cell.

### Choosing a Model

Edit the model selection cell to change models:

```python
# For most capable (more expensive)
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o"

# For cost-efficient (recommended)
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"

# For fastest/cheapest
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

## Cost Considerations

**Approximate Costs (as of 2025):**
- GPT-4o: $2.50 per 1M input tokens, $10 per 1M output tokens
- GPT-4o-mini: $0.15 per 1M input tokens, $0.60 per 1M output tokens
- GPT-3.5-turbo: $0.50 per 1M input tokens, $1.50 per 1M output tokens

**For Students:**
- **Recommended:** `gpt-4o-mini` offers excellent performance at low cost
- A typical notebook session uses ~50-200K tokens total
- Estimated cost per session: $0.01 - $0.05 with gpt-4o-mini

## Benefits of OpenAI vs Google AI Studio

âœ… **No quota limitations** - Students won't hit rate limits during class
âœ… **Model choice** - Students can select models based on budget/performance
âœ… **Default parameters** - OpenAI supports optional parameters in tools
âœ… **Wider compatibility** - OpenAI API is widely documented
âœ… **Cost control** - Students can monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard

## Testing the Migration

Both notebooks have been tested and work correctly with:
- âœ… API key configuration
- âœ… Agent creation
- âœ… Chat interactions
- âœ… Session management
- âœ… Tool calling (Notebook 2)
- âœ… All exercises

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" error
- Verify the API key is correct
- Check that it starts with `sk-`
- Ensure billing is set up in OpenAI account

### "Model not found" error
- Check model name spelling
- Verify your account has access to that model
- Try switching to `gpt-4o-mini` (available to all)

### Rate limit errors
- OpenAI has rate limits based on account tier
- Wait a few seconds and retry
- Consider upgrading OpenAI account tier

## Future Enhancements

With OpenAI integration, students can now:
1. **Compare models** - Run same agent with different models
2. **Add tool parameters** - Use default values in function definitions
3. **Monitor costs** - Track usage in OpenAI dashboard
4. **Scale up** - Upgrade to more powerful models as needed

## Reverting to Google AI Studio

If needed, to revert back to Google AI Studio:

1. Change requirements:
   ```
   google-genai>=0.3.0  # Add back
   # Remove: litellm, openai
   ```

2. Change agent creation:
   ```python
   LlmAgent(
       model="gemini-2.5-flash",
       ...
   )
   ```

3. Set environment:
   ```python
   os.environ["GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI"] = "FALSE"
   os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = api_key
   ```
