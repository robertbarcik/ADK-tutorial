    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand** why and when to use multi-agent systems\n",
    "2. **Implement** the hierarchical routing pattern (coordinator + specialists)\n",
    "3. **Create** specialized agents with domain-specific tools and expertise\n",
    "4. **Build** a coordinator agent that intelligently routes requests\n",
    "5. **Demonstrate** how agents communicate and transfer control\n",
    "6. **Apply** this pattern to real-world production scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Quick Recap: Lessons 1-2\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, you learned:\n",
    "- ✅ How to create basic agents with personality and instructions\n",
    "- ✅ How to give agents tools (function calling)\n",
    "- ✅ How to manage sessions and conversation context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation**: A single agent with many tools becomes complex, slow, and hard to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What's New in This Lesson?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build a **multi-agent system** using the **hierarchical routing pattern** - the most important design pattern for production AI systems. Instead of one agent doing everything, we'll create:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🎯 **Coordinator Agent**: Routes requests to the right specialist\n",
    "- 🔧 **Hardware Specialist**: Handles hardware issues with specialized tools\n",
    "- 💻 **Software Specialist**: Handles software issues with specialized tools\n",
    "- 🌐 **Network Specialist**: Handles network issues with specialized tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏢 Use Case: Enterprise IT Support System\n",

    "## 💡 Part 1: Why Multi-Agent Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Single-Agent Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine one IT support agent with 50+ tools:\n",
    "- ❌ **Overwhelming context**: Agent must understand all tools at once\n",
    "- ❌ **Slow responses**: More tools = more processing time\n",
    "- ❌ **Generic responses**: Jack of all trades, master of none\n",
    "- ❌ **Maintenance nightmare**: Updating one tool affects everything\n",
    "- ❌ **Cost inefficiency**: Using expensive models for simple tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Multi-Agent Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                    ┌─────────────────┐\n",
    "    User Request    │   Coordinator   │  (Routes to specialist)\n",
    "    ────────────>   │     Agent       │\n",
    "                    └────────┬────────┘\n",
    "                             │\n",

    "        3 tools        3 tools        3 tools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Hierarchical Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Specialization**: Each agent is an expert in their domain\n",
    "✅ **Faster responses**: Specialists only load relevant tools\n",
    "✅ **Better quality**: Focused instructions for each domain\n",
    "✅ **Easy maintenance**: Update one specialist without affecting others\n",
    "✅ **Scalability**: Add new specialists without rebuilding everything\n",
    "✅ **Cost optimization**: Use different models for different complexity levels\n",
    "✅ **Clear debugging**: Know exactly which agent handled each request\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is used in production by:\n",
    "- **Customer support**: Sales, technical, billing specialists\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Diagnosis, treatment, prescription specialists\n",
    "- **Finance**: Investment, risk, compliance specialists\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Product, shipping, returns specialists\n",
    "\n",

   "source": "## 💡 Part 7: Model Selection Strategy (Discussion)\n\nOne powerful feature of multi-agent systems is the ability to use **different models** for different complexity levels.\n\n### This Tutorial's Approach\n\n**We're using `gpt-5-nano` for all agents** to keep costs minimal while learning. This works great because:\n- ✅ Routing decisions are usually straightforward (keyword-based)\n- ✅ Specialist tasks follow structured processes\n- ✅ Most cost-efficient for educational purposes\n- ✅ Still demonstrates the hierarchical routing pattern perfectly\n\n### Production Model Selection Patterns\n\nIn production systems, you might use different models based on complexity:\n\n```python\n# Pattern 1: Smart coordinator, efficient specialists\ncoordinator = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"openai/gpt-4o\"))         # More capable\nspecialists = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"openai/gpt-5-nano\"))     # Cost-efficient\n# Use Case: Complex routing decisions with many edge cases\n\n# Pattern 2: All same model (what this tutorial uses)\nall_agents = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"openai/gpt-5-nano\"))      # Simplest\n# Use Case: Clear routing criteria, structured specialist tasks\n\n# Pattern 3: Mix models by task complexity\ncoordinator = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"openai/gpt-4o-mini\"))    # Mid-tier\nroutine_specialist = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"openai/gpt-5-nano\"))\ncomplex_specialist = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"openai/gpt-4o\"))\n# Use Case: Some specialists handle complex analysis, others do simple lookups\n\n# Pattern 4: Mix by provider (leverage strengths)\ncoordinator = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\"))\nspecialist1 = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"openai/gpt-5-nano\"))\nspecialist2 = LlmAgent(model=LiteLlm(model=\"gemini-2.0-flash-exp\"))\n# Use Case: Different models excel at different tasks\n```\n\n### Cost Comparison Example\n\nAssuming 1000 daily support requests:\n\n**Single Agent (gpt-4o for everything):**\n- 1000 requests × 1000 tokens × $0.01/1K = **$10/day**\n\n**Multi-Agent (gpt-5-nano for all):**\n- Coordinator: 1000 × 200 tokens × $0.0002/1K = **$0.04/day**\n- Specialists: 1000 × 800 tokens × $0.0002/1K = **$0.16/day**\n- **Total: $0.20/day (98% savings!)**\n\n**Multi-Agent (gpt-4o coordinator + gpt-5-nano specialists):**\n- Coordinator: 1000 × 200 tokens × $0.01/1K = **$2/day**\n- Specialists: 1000 × 800 tokens × $0.0002/1K = **$0.16/day**\n- **Total: $2.16/day (78% savings)**\n\n### When to Upgrade Models\n\nConsider using more powerful models when:\n\n| Scenario | Recommended Upgrade | Why |\n|----------|-------------------|------|\n| Complex routing logic | Coordinator → gpt-4o | Better at ambiguous cases |\n| Specialized analysis | That specialist → gpt-4o | Deeper reasoning needed |\n| High-stakes decisions | Critical agents → gpt-4o | Accuracy is paramount |\n| Simple lookups | Keep gpt-5-nano | No benefit from upgrade |\n\n### Key Insight\n\n**The multi-agent pattern gives you cost savings REGARDLESS of which models you use**, because:\n1. Each specialist loads fewer tools (faster, cheaper)\n2. You can mix models (expensive where needed, cheap elsewhere)\n3. Specialized instructions make agents more effective\n4. Clear separation makes debugging and optimization easier\n\n**For this tutorial, gpt-5-nano is perfect for learning the pattern!**\n\n---"

    "\n",
    "### Design Principles for Multi-Agent Systems 🏗️\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has one clear domain\n",
    "2. **Minimal Tools**: Specialists have 3-5 focused tools max\n",
    "3. **Clear Routing**: Coordinator has obvious decision criteria\n",
    "4. **Context Isolation**: Agents only see what they need\n",
    "5. **Graceful Fallback**: Handle unclear cases with clarifying questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Pattern 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Use Multi-Agent When:**\n",
    "- You have 10+ tools across different domains\n",
    "- Issues fall into clear categories\n",
    "- Different expertise levels are needed\n",
    "- You want to optimize costs\n",
    "- System needs to scale over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Single Agent is Fine When:**\n",
    "- You have < 5 tools total\n",
    "- All tools are closely related\n",
    "- Routing overhead isn't worth it\n",
    "- System is small and won't grow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications 🌍\n",
    "\n",
    "This exact pattern powers:\n",
    "- **Customer Service**: Route by department (sales, support, billing)\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Route by specialty (general, specialist, pharmacy)\n",
    "- **Finance**: Route by function (trading, research, compliance)\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Route by topic (products, orders, returns)\n",
    "- **HR Systems**: Route by category (payroll, benefits, recruitment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Future lessons will cover:\n",
    "- **Advanced State Management**: Persistent sessions with Firestore\n",
    "- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Specialists collaborating\n",
    "- **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Creating specialists on-the-fly\n",
    "- **MCP Integration**: Connecting to external tool servers\n",
    "- **Production Deployment**: Scaling multi-agent systems\n",
