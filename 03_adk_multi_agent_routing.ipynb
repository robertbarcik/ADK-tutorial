              "'Thanks for the details. Here’s what I’m seeing and the fastest next steps.\\n\\nWhat the tests show\\n- 192.168.1.1 (your gateway) is not reachable from this test, meaning the device can see the AP but can’t reach the router/gateway.\\n- 8.8.8.8 is reachable but with some instability (2% packet loss). Internet access appears intermittent once past the gateway, which points to a local LAN/AP issue rather than a totally down Internet.\\n- Office Wi‑Fi bandwidth looks good (~437 Mbps down, 21 Mbps up) with about 32 ms latency, so the external link isn’t the bottleneck.\\n\\nLikely causes\\n- The device is not obtaining an IP from the DHCP server, or the DHCP lease is failing.\\n- The device is connected to the correct SSID but cannot reach the router due to a misconfiguration, AP issue, or local firewall/isolation on the device.\\n- AP or gateway hardware issue on the office network.\\n\\nQuick things to try (on your device)\\n- Forget the Office Wi‑Fi network, then reconnect and re-enter the password (to refresh the DHCP lease).\\n- Ensure you’re connecting to the correct Office SSID (some offices have multiple networks with similar names).\\n- On your device, check that DHCP is enabled:\\n  - Windows: open Command Prompt and run ipconfig /all to see if an IP like 192.168.1.x is assigned; if not, run ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew.\\n  - macOS/Linux: check via ifconfig/ip a and renew DHCP if needed.\\n- If possible, try connecting another device to the same Office Wi‑Fi to see if it can reach the gateway (192.168.1.1). If others can’t reach the gateway either, the issue is likely with the AP/gateway and not your device.\\n- If you have a wired Ethernet option, test that to rule out a Wi‑Fi hardware issue on the device.\\n\\nIf you want me to take action on the network device\\n- I can perform a router reset to refresh the gateway and clear potential stale sessions.\\n- Please confirm the location string for the office router/gateway (e.g., “Office Main Router” or “Office Floor 1 Gateway”). Note: this will cause a short outage as the router reboots.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Try the quick device checks above.\\n- If the problem persists, I can reset the Office gateway to restore connectivity.

        "\n",
        "1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has one clear domain\n",
        "2. **Minimal Tools**: Specialists have 3-5 focused tools max\n",
        "3. **Clear Routing**: Coordinator has obvious decision criteria\n",
        "4. **Context Isolation**: Agents only see what they need\n",
        "5. **Graceful Fallback**: Handle unclear cases with clarifying questions\n",

        "### When to Use This Pattern 📊\n",

        "**✅ Use Multi-Agent When:**\n",
        "- You have 10+ tools across different domains\n",
        "- Issues fall into clear categories\n",
        "- Different expertise levels are needed\n",
        "- You want to optimize costs\n",
        "- System needs to scale over time\n",
        "\n",
        "**❌ Single Agent is Fine When:**\n",
        "- You have < 5 tools total\n",
        "- All tools are closely related\n",
        "- Routing overhead isn't worth it\n",
        "- System is small and won't grow\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real-World Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "This exact pattern powers:\n",
        "- **Customer Service**: Route by department (sales, support, billing)\n",
        "- **Healthcare**: Route by specialty (general, specialist, pharmacy)\n",
        "- **Finance**: Route by function (trading, research, compliance)\n",
        "- **E-commerce**: Route by topic (products, orders, returns)\n",
        "- **HR Systems**: Route by category (payroll, benefits, recruitment)\n",
