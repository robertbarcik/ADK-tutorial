        "1. **Understand** what tools are in the context of AI agents\n",
        "2. **Create** Python functions that agents can use as tools\n",
        "3. **Implement** proper type hints and docstrings for automatic tool schema generation\n",
        "4. **Observe** how agents decide when and how to use tools\n",
        "5. **Debug** tool execution to understand the agent's decision-making process\n",

        "\n",
        "### The Problem Without Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "In Lesson 1, our agent could only generate text responses. It couldn't:\n",
        "- ❌ Look up real data\n",
        "- ❌ Perform actions\n",
        "- ❌ Access external systems\n",
        "- ❌ Execute code\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Solution: Function Calling (Tools)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tools** are Python functions that agents can call to extend their capabilities. Think of them as giving your agent hands to interact with the world!\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Tools Work in ADK\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "1. User asks: \"What's the status of ticket #1234?\"\n",
        "   ↓\n",
        "2. Agent analyzes: \"I need to use the check_ticket_status tool\"\n",
        "   ↓\n",
        "3. ADK calls: check_ticket_status(ticket_id=\"1234\")\n",
        "   ↓\n",
        "4. Function returns: {\"status\": \"in_progress\", \"assigned_to\": \"tech_jane\"}\n",
        "   ↓\n",
        "5. Agent responds: \"Ticket #1234 is in progress, assigned to Jane.\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Automatic Schema Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "ADK automatically inspects your Python functions and generates a schema that tells the LLM:\n",
        "- **Function name**: What the tool is called\n",
        "- **Docstring**: What the tool does\n",
        "- **Type hints**: What parameters it expects\n",
        "- **Return type**: What it returns\n",
        "\n",
        "This means you just write **normal Python functions** with good documentation!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Anatomy of a Good Tool Function\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def tool_name(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> Dict[str, any]:\n",
        "    \"\"\"\n",
        "    Clear description of what this tool does.\n",
        "    \n",

        "### What You Learned  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Tool Concept**\n",
        "   - Tools are Python functions that extend agent capabilities\n",
        "   - Agents automatically decide when to use tools\n",
        "   - Function calling bridges conversation and action\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Creating Effective Tools**\n",
        "   - Use comprehensive docstrings\n",
        "   - Add type hints for all parameters\n",
        "   - Return dictionaries with descriptive keys\n",
        "   - Choose meaningful function names\n",
        "   - Design for the LLM to understand\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ADK's Automatic Magic**\n",
        "   - ADK inspects function signatures automatically\n",
        "   - Converts Python functions to LLM-understandable schemas\n",
        "   - Handles parameter validation and type conversion\n",
        "   - Manages tool execution flow\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Best Practices**\n",
        "   - Keep tools focused (single responsibility)\n",
        "   - Handle errors gracefully\n",
        "   - Return structured data\n",
        "   - Use optional parameters with defaults\n",
        "   - Add debug logging for development\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Reminders ⚠️\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Security**: When creating real tools:\n",
        "   - Validate all inputs\n",
        "   - Implement access controls\n",
        "   - Log all tool executions\n",
        "   - Rate limit expensive operations\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Testing**: Always test tools:\n",
        "   - Independently (unit tests)\n",
        "   - With the agent (integration tests)\n",
        "   - Edge cases and error conditions\n",
